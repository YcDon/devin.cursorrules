Create fine-tuning job
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs
Creates a fine-tuning job which begins the process of creating a new model from a given dataset.

Response includes details of the enqueued job including job status and the name of the fine-tuned models once complete.

Request body
model
string

Required
The name of the model to fine-tune. You can select one of the supported models.

training_file
string

Required
The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.

See upload file for how to upload a file.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose fine-tune.

The contents of the file should differ depending on if the model uses the chat, completions format, or if the fine-tuning method uses the preference format.

See the fine-tuning guide for more details.

hyperparameters
Deprecated
object

Optional
The hyperparameters used for the fine-tuning job. This value is now deprecated in favor of method, and should be passed in under the method parameter.


Show properties
suffix
string or null

Optional
Defaults to null
A string of up to 64 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.

For example, a suffix of "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like ft:gpt-4o-mini:openai:custom-model-name:7p4lURel.

validation_file
string or null

Optional
The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.

If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in the fine-tuning results file. The same data should not be present in both train and validation files.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. You must upload your file with the purpose fine-tune.

See the fine-tuning guide for more details.

integrations
array or null

Optional
A list of integrations to enable for your fine-tuning job.


Show properties
seed
integer or null

Optional
The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but may differ in rare cases. If a seed is not specified, one will be generated for you.

method
object

Optional
The method used for fine-tuning.


Show properties
Returns
A fine-tuning.job object.
